-- Day 2 

In this project, I focused on ensuring the correct and safe behavior of an ATM program. 
The application handles invalid user input gracefully and prevents crashes by validating
numeric values before processing operations.

The project demonstrates the use of `while` loops for continuous execution and `if / elif / else`
statements for decision-making and flow control.
